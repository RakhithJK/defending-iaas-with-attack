Overview

  Whenever you update overview.rst, also look at README.md and consider whether
  you should make a corresponding update there.

**Defending IaaS with ATT&CK** delivers a custom collection of MITRE ATT&CKÂ®
techniques that is tailored to the attack surface and threat model of a
Linux-based, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment. The project
provides a notional architecture for this target environment and a
:doc:`machine-readable collection <collection>` of ATT&CK techniques that can be
used to plan and evaluate security controls.

Every organization is unique, and even within an organization there may be a
variety of technical architectures. The collection delivered by this project
targets a very specific technical architecture, but to support the wider
community organizations can use the :doc:`project methodology <methodology>` to
create custom collections of techniques that are tailored to their exact
circumstances and needs.

Organizations using Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) need to understand the
techniques adversaries can use against them--whether they occur at the cloud
management layer, the container technology, or virtual machines. Organizations
seeking a holistic view of adversary activities need to draw from multiple
ATT&CK matrices. For example, you might consult the following:

* `Linux Matrix <https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/linux/>`__
* `Cloud (IaaS) Matrix <https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/iaas/>`__
* `Containers Matrix <https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/containers/>`__

Keeping track of techniques across three different matrices can be difficult,
and you will also find that some techniques do not apply to your architecture.
(For example, this project excludes Windows techniques.) To this end, the
Defending IaaS project defines a notional archictecture and a corresponding
attack surface, then pulls together techniques from multiple matrices into a
:doc:`single, convenient collection <collection>`. This collection can be used
visualized, customized, or extended in ATT&CK Navigator and ATT&CK Workbench.

Use Cases
---------

The Defending IaaS collection and the associated methodology support the
following use cases:

* Evaluate Security Controls
    * Visualize detective and preventive controls across the entire attack
      surface.
    * Combine with `Security Stack Mappings
      <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/security-stack-mappings>`__
      to identify the pertinent security controls provided by your IaaS vendor.
* Build End-to-End Threat Models
    * Understand the capabilities and impacts of end users vs insiders vs
      external actors.
* Simulate Adversary Behavior
    * Run tabletop exercises.
    * Build adversary emulation plans.
    * Conduct penetration testing / red team engagements.

Get Started
-----------

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

* :newsgroup:`Review the collection.` The :doc:`collection <collection>` chapter describes
  how the collection is consistuted and how you can use it.
* :newsgroup:`Learn the methodology.` The Defending IaaS collection is helpful
  in its own right, but the :doc:`methodology <methodology>` is provided for
  organizations to create their own tailored collections.
* :newsgroup:`Build and share your own collections!` ATT&CK Workbench is
  upgraded with new features to make it easier than ever to build your own
  collections. You can use custom collections privately or publish them to
  benefit the community.
* :newsgroup:`Tell us what you think.` Find us `on LinkedIn

  Let us know how you're using the project and what ideas you have to improve
  it.

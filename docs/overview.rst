Introduction
-------------

(TODO customize this section)

The Attack Flow project helps defenders move from tracking adversary behaviors
individually, to the sequence of techniques adversaries use, to achieve their
goals. Understanding the context within those sequences, as well as the
relationships among them, enables additional defensive capabilities that make
defenders much more effective. The project seeks to demonstrate how attack flows
can explain defensive posture to executives, aid defenders to understand
lessons-learned from an incident, and support red-teamers to easily compose
realistic adversary emulation scenarios.

Get Involved
------------

(TODO customize this section)

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- :newsgroup:`Tell us what you think.` Check out the (TODO), take the
  (TODO) for a spin, and review the (TODO).
- :newsgroup:`Help us prioritize additional example flows to create.` Let us know what
  examples you would like to turned into an Attack Flow. Your input will help us
  prioritize how we expand our corpus.
- :newsgroup:`Share your use cases.` We are interested in developing additional tools
  and resources to help the community understand and make threat-informed decisions in
  their risk management programs. If you have ideas or suggestions, we consider them as
  we explore additional research projects.

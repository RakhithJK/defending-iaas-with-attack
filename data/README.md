# Defending IaaS with ATT&CK Threat Collection

The DIWA threat collection was built using ATT&CK workbench to provide cyber analysts with a file that's easily shared in STIX JSON format. 
This collection includes 277 unique MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, or procedures that were deemed applicable for IaaS along with notes that include the justification for cloud technologies. 


## Collections
Collections are sets of related ATT&CK objects, and may be used to represent specific releases of a dataset such as “Enterprise ATT&CK v9.0” or any other set of objects one may want to share with someone else.## STIX
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).

## STIX
STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine-readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.
STIX is designed to improve different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.
